# Traffic Sign Detection – Paper Review

This repository contains a deep learning paper review and experimental implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for traffic sign detection. The project is based on the research paper:

> “Advancing Traffic Sign Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks: A Deep Learning Approach”

---

## Project Purpose

Traffic sign detection is essential for autonomous driving, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and computer vision research. This project reviews key ideas from the paper, explores preprocessing strategies, CNN architecture, and evaluates model performance empirically.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, resizing, and normalizing traffic sign images.  
2. **CNN Implementation** – Building and training the CNN model as described in the paper.  
3. **Evaluation** – Measuring model accuracy, analyzing results, and discussing limitations.  
4. **Analysis & Review** – Understanding the paper’s methodology and experimental design.

Traffic Sign Detection – Deep Learning Paper Review
Overview

This repository contains an academic deep learning paper review and experimental analysis focused on traffic sign detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project is based on the research paper “Advancing Traffic Sign Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks: A Deep Learning Approach” and includes a structured theoretical review, mathematical analysis, and empirical evaluation.

The objective is to understand, analyze, and reproduce key ideas from the proposed RoadNet architecture while critically examining its preprocessing strategies, model design, training procedure, and performance metrics.
